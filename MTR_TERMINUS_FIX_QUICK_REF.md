# MTR Terminus Detection - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

Direction filter was incorrectly hidden at intermediate stations because they appeared in API terminus codes.

## ❌ Before Fix (BROKEN)

**Stations incorrectly treated as terminus:**
- East Rail Line: Sha Tin, Fo Tan, Racecourse, Sheung Shui, Tai Po Market
- Tseung Kwan O Line: Tiu Keng Leng, LOHAS Park (in wrong direction)
- All intermediate stations with service variations

**Result**: Direction filter hidden when it should be shown

## ✅ After Fix (CORRECT)

**True terminus stations** (only first/last on line):
- East Rail Line: Admiralty ↔ Lok Ma Chau
- Tseung Kwan O Line: North Point ↔ Po Lam/LOHAS Park
- Island Line: Kennedy Town ↔ Chai Wan
- Kwun Tong Line: Whampoa ↔ Tiu Keng Leng

**All other stations**: Show direction filter ✅

## 🔧 Technical Change

### Old Logic (WRONG)
```dart
bool isTerminusStation(String stationCode) {
  // Returns true if station appears in ANY terminus list
  for (final terminusList in directionTermini.values) {
    if (terminusList.contains(stationCode)) {
      return true; // ❌ WRONG
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```
**Problem**: Confuses API terminus codes (where trains may terminate) with actual end-of-line terminus stations

### New Logic (CORRECT)
```dart
bool isTerminusStation(String stationCode) {
  if (stations.isEmpty) return false;
  
  // Only first and last stations are true terminus
  final firstStation = stations.first.stationCode;
  final lastStation = stations.last.stationCode;
  
  return stationCode == firstStation || stationCode == lastStation;
}
```
**Solution**: Uses station list order to identify true end-of-line terminus stations

## 📊 Impact Examples

| Station | Line | Before | After | Correct |
|---------|------|--------|-------|---------|
| Sha Tin | EAL | No Filter | ✅ Filter | ✅ |
| Fo Tan | EAL | No Filter | ✅ Filter | ✅ |
| Racecourse | EAL | No Filter | ✅ Filter | ✅ |
| Admiralty | EAL | No Filter | No Filter | ✅ |
| Tiu Keng Leng | TKL | No Filter | ✅ Filter | ✅ |
| Po Lam | TKL | No Filter | No Filter | ✅ |

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test Case 1: Sha Tin (East Rail Line)
1. Select East Rail Line
2. Select Sha Tin station
3. **Expected**: Direction filter should appear (UP/DOWN buttons)
4. **Before Fix**: ❌ No filter shown
5. **After Fix**: ✅ Filter shown

### Test Case 2: Admiralty (East Rail Line)
1. Select East Rail Line
2. Select Admiralty station
3. **Expected**: Direction filter should NOT appear (true terminus)
4. **Before Fix**: ✅ No filter (correct)
5. **After Fix**: ✅ No filter (still correct)

### Test Case 3: Tiu Keng Leng (Tseung Kwan O Line)
1. Select Tseung Kwan O Line
2. Select Tiu Keng Leng station
3. **Expected**: Direction filter should appear (interchange station)
4. **Before Fix**: ❌ No filter shown
5. **After Fix**: ✅ Filter shown

## 📝 Understanding API Terminus Codes

### What API Terminus Codes Mean
```json
"directions": {
  "UP": ["LMC", "LOW", "SHS", "TAP", "RAC", "FOT", "SHT"],
  "DOWN": ["ADM", "HUH", "MKK"]
}
```

**These are NOT station types** - they indicate where different train services may terminate:
- Some UP trains go all the way to Lok Ma Chau (LMC)
- Some UP trains terminate at Sheung Shui (SHS)
- Some UP trains terminate at Sha Tin (SHT) during off-peak
- Racecourse (RAC) trains only run on race days

### True Terminus vs Service Terminus

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **True Terminus** | First or last station on the line | Kennedy Town, Chai Wan |
| **Service Terminus** | Where some services terminate | Sha Tin, Fo Tan, Racecourse |

**Direction filter rules:**
- Hide at TRUE terminus stations ✅
- Show at SERVICE terminus stations ✅

## 🔍 Debugging

### Check if Station is Terminus
```dart
final isTerminus = line.isTerminusStation(stationCode);
print('$stationCode is terminus: $isTerminus');
```

### Get Terminus Codes (for debugging)
```dart
final isTerminusCode = line.isTerminusCode(stationCode);
print('$stationCode appears in terminus codes: $isTerminusCode');
```

### Example Output
```
// Sha Tin on EAL
SHT is terminus: false          // Correct - it's a through station
SHT appears in terminus codes: true  // Yes - some trains terminate here

// Admiralty on EAL
ADM is terminus: true           // Correct - it's the line terminus
ADM appears in terminus codes: true  // Yes - it's in DOWN terminus list
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Direction filter appears where it should
2. **Consistent behavior**: Clear rules based on station position
3. **Accurate filtering**: Users can filter trains at all through stations
4. **Less confusion**: Matches user expectations
