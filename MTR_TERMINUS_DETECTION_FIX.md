# MTR Terminus Detection Fix

## Problem Statement

The direction filter was being incorrectly hidden for many intermediate stations because the terminus detection logic was confusing **terminus codes** in the API data with **actual terminus stations**.

### Issue Examples

**East Rail Line (EAL)**:
- Stations like Racecourse (RAC), Fo Tan (FOT), Sha Tin (SHT) were treated as terminus stations
- These stations appeared in the API's UP direction terminus list: `["LMC", "LOW", "SHS", "TAP", "RAC", "FOT", "SHT"]`
- But they are NOT true terminus stations - they are through stations where some services terminate

**Tseung Kwan O Line (TKL)**:
- Tiu Keng Leng (TIK) was treated as a terminus station
- It appears in DOWN direction: `["TIK", "NOP"]` (branch split)
- But it's actually a through station with branching services

**Impact**:
- Direction filter was hidden when it should be shown
- Users at intermediate stations couldn't filter train directions
- Confusing UX at stations like Sha Tin, Fo Tan, Racecourse, etc.

## Root Cause

### Before Fix (INCORRECT)
```dart
bool isTerminusStation(String stationCode) {
  // Check if station appears in ANY direction's terminus list
  for (final terminusList in directionTermini.values) {
    if (terminusList.contains(stationCode)) {
      return true; // ❌ WRONG: Returns true for intermediate stations
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

**Why this was wrong**:
- The API's `directions` data contains **terminus codes** for train services, not station types
- A terminus code indicates where a particular train service terminates
- Multiple services may terminate at different intermediate stations (e.g., some EAL trains stop at Sha Tin, others continue to Lo Wu)
- This is especially common on lines with branches or special services

### API Data Structure
```json
{
  "line_code": "EAL",
  "stations": ["ADM", "EXC", "HUH", "MKK", "KOT", "TAW", "SHT", "FOT", "RAC", "UNI", "TAP", "TWO", "FAN", "SHS", "LOW", "LMC"],
  "directions": {
    "UP": ["LMC", "LOW", "SHS", "TAP", "RAC", "FOT", "SHT"],  // Multiple terminus codes
    "DOWN": ["ADM", "HUH", "MKK"]  // Multiple terminus codes
  }
}
```

**Interpretation**:
- `stations` list: All stations on the line **in order**
- `directions.UP`: Stations where UP trains may terminate (service variations)
- `directions.DOWN`: Stations where DOWN trains may terminate (service variations)
- **TRUE terminus stations**: Only first ("ADM") and last ("LMC") in stations list

## Solution

### After Fix (CORRECT)
```dart
/// Check if a station is a TRUE terminus station (first or last station on the line)
/// This is different from a terminus CODE in the API which may represent services
/// that terminate at intermediate stations (like Racecourse, Fo Tan, etc.)
/// Only actual end-of-line terminus stations should return true
bool isTerminusStation(String stationCode) {
  if (stations.isEmpty) return false;
  
  // A station is a true terminus only if it's the first or last station on the line
  final firstStation = stations.first.stationCode;
  final lastStation = stations.last.stationCode;
  
  return stationCode == firstStation || stationCode == lastStation;
}

/// Check if a station appears as a terminus code in the API data
/// This may include intermediate stations where some services terminate
/// (e.g., Racecourse on EAL, LOHAS Park on TKL)
bool isTerminusCode(String stationCode) {
  for (final terminusList in directionTermini.values) {
    if (terminusList.contains(stationCode)) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

**Why this is correct**:
- Uses the **stations list order** to determine true terminus stations
- First station in list = one terminus (e.g., ADM for EAL)
- Last station in list = other terminus (e.g., LMC for EAL)
- All stations in between = through stations (should show direction filter)
- Provides separate `isTerminusCode()` for future use if needed

## Technical Details

### True Terminus Stations by Line

Based on station list order (first and last):

| Line Code | Line Name | First Terminus | Last Terminus |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| AEL | Airport Express | HOK (Hong Kong) | AWE (AsiaWorld-Expo) |
| TCL | Tung Chung Line | HOK (Hong Kong) | TUC (Tung Chung) |
| TML | Tuen Ma Line | WKS (Wu Kai Sha) | TUM (Tuen Mun) |
| TKL | Tseung Kwan O Line | NOP (North Point) | POA (Po Lam) |
| EAL | East Rail Line | ADM (Admiralty) | LMC (Lok Ma Chau) |
| SIL | South Island Line | ADM (Admiralty) | SOH (South Horizons) |
| TWL | Tsuen Wan Line | CEN (Central) | TSW (Tsuen Wan) |
| ISL | Island Line | KET (Kennedy Town) | CHW (Chai Wan) |
| KTL | Kwun Tong Line | WHA (Whampoa) | TIK (Tiu Keng Leng) |
| DRL | Disneyland Resort Line | SUN (Sunny Bay) | DIS (Disneyland Resort) |

### Through Stations (Should Show Direction Filter)

**All other stations** that are not first or last should show the direction filter.

**Examples of through stations that were incorrectly treated as terminus**:
- **EAL**: SHT, FOT, RAC, UNI, TAP, TWO, FAN, SHS, LOW (all intermediate)
- **TKL**: QUB, YAT, TIK, TKO, LHP, HAH (all intermediate)
- **TML**: All intermediate stations except WKS and TUM

## Direction Filter Logic

The direction filter visibility now correctly follows this logic:

```dart
// Check if selected station is a terminus station
final isTerminus = widget.selectedStation != null && 
                   widget.selectedLine != null &&
                   widget.selectedLine!.isTerminusStation(widget.selectedStation!.stationCode);

// Only show direction filter for through trains (non-terminus stations)
if (!hasDirections || widget.selectedStation == null || isTerminus) {
  return const SizedBox.shrink(); // Hide filter
}

// Show filter for through stations
return AnimatedContainer(...); // Show direction filter
```

**Rules**:
1. ✅ Show filter if station is a through station (not first/last)
2. ❌ Hide filter if station is a true terminus (first/last)
3. ❌ Hide filter if no directions configured
4. ❌ Hide filter if no station selected

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
✅ Test at **Sha Tin (SHT)** on EAL - should show direction filter  
✅ Test at **Fo Tan (FOT)** on EAL - should show direction filter  
✅ Test at **Racecourse (RAC)** on EAL - should show direction filter  
✅ Test at **Admiralty (ADM)** on EAL - should hide direction filter (true terminus)  
✅ Test at **Lok Ma Chau (LMC)** on EAL - should hide direction filter (true terminus)  
✅ Test at **Tiu Keng Leng (TIK)** on TKL - should show direction filter  
✅ Test at **Po Lam (POA)** on TKL - should hide direction filter (true terminus)  
✅ Test at **LOHAS Park (LHP)** on TKL - should hide direction filter (true terminus)  

### Edge Cases
✅ Lines with single station - handled by `stations.isEmpty` check  
✅ Lines with two stations - first and last both treated as terminus  
✅ Interchange stations - treated as through stations unless first/last  
✅ Special service stations (Racecourse) - correctly treated as through stations  

## User Experience Impact

### Before Fix
- Users at intermediate stations like Sha Tin couldn't filter train directions
- Confusing why direction filter appeared at some stations but not others
- No way to distinguish between "To Admiralty" vs "To Lo Wu/Lok Ma Chau" trains

### After Fix
- Direction filter appears at all through stations ✅
- Users can filter trains by destination at intermediate stations ✅
- Better UX for busy interchange stations ✅
- Matches user expectations (only hide filter at actual end-of-line) ✅

## Future Considerations

### Potential Use of `isTerminusCode()`
The new `isTerminusCode()` method could be useful for:
1. **Train display logic**: Showing which trains actually terminate vs pass through
2. **Platform indicators**: Different display for terminating vs through trains
3. **Service patterns**: Understanding train service variations on a line
4. **Analytics**: Tracking terminus service patterns

### API Enhancement Opportunity
Consider requesting MTR to provide:
- Explicit `is_terminus_station` field in API
- Service pattern indicators (e.g., "short-turn", "full-service")
- Real-time indication of which terminus trains are headed to

**Lines Affected**: EAL, TKL, TML (most significantly)
